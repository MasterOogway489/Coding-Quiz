# Coding-Quiz

## Description


The purpose of this project was to create a website that provides the user with a quiz that you can interact with via Javascript.
I built it to allow a user to take a short quiz that tests knowlege on several questions regarding vocabulary words that come up in web development.
Throughout the course of creating this website I learned many of the practical applications of javascript and ways to allow the user to interact with my websites.
